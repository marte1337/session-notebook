Naming branches
It is good practice to use short descriptive names for your feature branches, e.g. contact-form. We recommend using hyphens as separators as they make the name more comfortable to read.

Git branch commands
command	functionality
git switch -c <branchname>	create a new branch and switch to it
git switch <branchname>	switch branches
git branch	list your branches
git branch -a	list all branches (local and remote)
git branch -d <branchname>	delete a branch
Git pull requests
GitHub offers us pull requests (PR) which we can use as a convenient way to request reviews of the work on a feature branch.

A pull request is a request to merge one branch into another branch. Other developers review the PR and suggest changes. If a pull request is approved we can merge the feature branch into the main branch.

Basic Workflow for a pull request
Create a new branch with git switch -c <branchname>.
Make changes to the code / write your code fpr the feature.
Push the changes and the new branch with git push -u origin <branchname> (after you have done this once you can use git push for this branch)
Create a pull request on GitHub from the new branch into main
Share the pull request with your team
Review the pull request, implement changes if needed, push again to update the pull request until it gets approved
Merge the pull request into main
Don't forget to git pull inside the main branch on your local machine
Delete the new branch on GitHub and locally
