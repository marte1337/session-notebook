## Naming branches

It is good practice to use short descriptive names for your feature branches, e.g. contact-form.
We recommend using hyphens as separators as they make the name more comfortable to read.

### Git branch commands

| command                      | functionality                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| git switch -c <branchname> | create a new branch and switch to it |
| git switch <branchname>    | switch branches                      |
| git branch                 | list your branches                   |
| git branch -a              | list all branches (local and remote) |
| git branch -d <branchname> | delete a branch                      |
